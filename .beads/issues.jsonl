{"id":"skyreader-ojg","title":"change background to purple","description":"## Implementation Plan: Change App Background to Purple\n\n### Overview\nChange the main application background color from white/dark gray to purple (`#6b21a8`) in both light and dark modes, ensuring proper text contrast and visual hierarchy.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Main background (`--color-bg`) is purple `#6b21a8` in light mode\n- [ ] Main background (`--color-bg`) is a darker purple in dark mode for differentiation\n- [ ] Text remains readable (WCAG AA contrast ratio 4.5:1 minimum)\n- [ ] Secondary background (`--color-bg-secondary`) harmonizes with purple theme\n- [ ] Input fields and cards remain visually distinct\n- [ ] Sidebar active state visible against purple background\n- [ ] No linter errors\n- [ ] App renders correctly in both light and dark modes\n\n### Implementation Steps\n1. Update `:root` CSS variables in `app.css`:\n   - Change `--color-bg: #ffffff` to `--color-bg: #6b21a8`\n   - Update `--color-bg-secondary` to a complementary purple (e.g., `#7c3aed` lighter or `#581c87` darker)\n   - Update `--color-text` to light color (`#f3f4f6` or `#ffffff`) for contrast\n   - Update `--color-text-secondary` to a lighter muted color\n   - Update `--color-border` to visible purple shade\n   - Update `--color-sidebar-active` to work on purple\n\n2. Update dark mode CSS variables in `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`:\n   - Change `--color-bg` to darker purple (e.g., `#4c1d95` or `#3b0764`)\n   - Adjust secondary background accordingly\n   - Ensure text colors maintain contrast\n\n3. Update theme-color meta tag in `+layout.svelte` to match new purple theme\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `frontend/src/app.css` - Lines 1-42 (CSS variable definitions for both modes)\n- `frontend/src/routes/+layout.svelte` - Line 236 (theme-color meta tag)\n\n### Testing\n- Open app in browser, verify purple background displays\n- Toggle system dark mode, verify darker purple appears\n- Check text readability across all pages\n- Verify input fields, cards, buttons are visually distinct\n- Test sidebar highlighting is visible\n\n### Edge Cases\n- Cards use `--color-bg` - may need to stand out from main background (consider using secondary color)\n- Input fields use `--color-bg` - ensure they're distinguishable from page background\n- Some components may have hardcoded colors - search for any direct color values\n\n### Color Palette Reference\nSuggested palette based on `#6b21a8`:\n- Light mode bg: `#6b21a8` (user specified)\n- Dark mode bg: `#4c1d95` (darker purple)\n- Secondary: `#7c3aed` (lighter purple) or `#581c87` (deeper purple)\n- Text: `#f9fafb` (near white)\n- Text secondary: `#d4d4d8` (light gray)\n- Border: `#9333ea` (bright purple for visibility)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"tim@disnetdev.com","created_at":"2026-01-18T21:45:27.917242-08:00","created_by":"Tim Disney","updated_at":"2026-01-18T21:49:38.952159-08:00","labels":["needs-clarification","plan-ready"],"comments":[{"id":1,"issue_id":"skyreader-ojg","author":"Tim Disney","text":"## Clarification Needed\n\nBefore I can create an implementation plan, I need to understand a few things:\n\n### 1. Which background should change?\nThe app has multiple backgrounds:\n- **Main app background** (`--color-bg`) - affects entire app body\n- **Secondary background** (`--color-bg-secondary`) - used for cards, code blocks, hover states\n- **Sidebar active state** (`--color-sidebar-active`) - highlight for active sidebar items\n\nAre you referring to the main app background?\n\n### 2. What shade of purple?\nPlease specify one of:\n- A specific hex code (e.g., `#6b21a8`)\n- A general tone (e.g., light lavender, deep violet, muted purple)\n- A reference (e.g., \"like Bluesky's purple\")\n\n### 3. Should this affect both light and dark modes?\nCurrently the app has:\n- Light mode: white background (`#ffffff`)\n- Dark mode: dark gray background (`#1a1a1a`)\n\nOptions:\n- **A)** Purple in both modes (different shades for each)\n- **B)** Purple in light mode only, dark purple/gray in dark mode\n- **C)** Replace dark mode with purple theme\n\n### 4. Is this a permanent change or a theme option?\n- **A)** Permanent change - purple becomes the default\n- **B)** New theme option - user can choose purple\n\nPlease respond in a comment and I'll generate the implementation plan.","created_at":"2026-01-19T05:46:45Z"},{"id":2,"issue_id":"skyreader-ojg","author":"Tim Disney","text":"1. main app background\n2. #6b21a8\n3. yes both\n4. permanent","created_at":"2026-01-19T05:47:54Z"},{"id":3,"issue_id":"skyreader-ojg","author":"Tim Disney","text":"## Original Request\n\n\u003e Change background to purple\n\n## User Clarifications\n1.
