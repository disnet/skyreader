Which background should change?\nThe app has multiple backgrounds:\n- **Main app background** (`--color-bg`) - affects entire app body\n- **Secondary background** (`--color-bg-secondary`) - used for cards, code blocks, hover states\n- **Sidebar active state** (`--color-sidebar-active`) - highlight for active sidebar items\n\nAre you referring to the main app background?\n\n### 2. What shade of purple?\nPlease specify one of:\n- A specific hex code (e.g., `#6b21a8`)\n- A general tone (e.g., light lavender, deep violet, muted purple)\n- A reference (e.g., \"like Bluesky's purple\")\n\n### 3. Should this affect both light and dark modes?\nCurrently the app has:\n- Light mode: white background (`#ffffff`)\n- Dark mode: dark gray background (`#1a1a1a`)\n\nOptions:\n- **A)** Purple in both modes (different shades for each)\n- **B)** Purple in light mode only, dark purple/gray in dark mode\n- **C)** Replace dark mode with purple theme\n\n### 4. Is this a permanent change or a theme option?\n- **A)** Permanent change - purple becomes the default\n- **B)** New theme option - user can choose purple\n\nPlease respond in a comment and I'll generate the implementation plan.","created_at":"2026-01-19T05:46:45Z"}]}
